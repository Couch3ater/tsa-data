! client has requested a "tab bar" at the top of the page to control views
! follow angular conventions for app initialization
! basic design -- emphasis on the data: easy to view, explore, etc
! use any css/design framework

~ client would like to be able to:
	-> filter each view of the data by additional criteria (claim type, claim site).
	-> add data to the dataset through an input field. required fields: Incident Date, Airport Code, Value
	! views should update dynamically for both of these requests

line plots: value lost per month (close-amount; column 10) by airline (airline-name; column 6) for all three years (date-received; column 2)
	-> there are 179 unique airlines
	-> determine break-points for close amount

bar graph: average claim amount per month (close amount; column 10) by airport (airport-code; column 4) for all three years (date-received; column 2). display mean and std-dev on each bar
	-> there are 404 unique airports.
	-> determine break-points for average (if necessary)

considerations:
	-> look for graphing libraries to utilize
		-] Chart.js
	-> in order to display the information on mobile, it may be best to use large panels with a "nav" style of tab navigation
	-> on desktop, the navigation can be broken out by data view (title them, or just name the tab with the view?) with drop downs for year
		-] on mobile, this would translate well to a collapsible accordion-style nav
	-> 3 years of data, so separate views into panels
	-> data assumptions: a hyphen in the data indicates "other"? 
	-> convert xls data? is there a js library for this or will i need a csv?
		-] papaparse to convert data to json?
	-> on-hover tool-tip on bar graph for mean / std-dev

todo:
	-> app load : import necessary libraries : import data to json : load first view : update view with airline-name / airport (dropdown), year (tabs), or month (dropdown?) as needed
